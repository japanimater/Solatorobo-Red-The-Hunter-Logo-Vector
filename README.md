# Solatorobo-Red-The-Hunter-Logo-Vector
The image files contained within this repository are vector images I made of Solatorobo Red The Hunter, a Nintendo DS game. 
The aforementioned game was published by Bandai Namco, developed by CyberConnect2, and is part of the larger Little Tail Bronx world/lore.
The original logo has a rough finish along the outline of the "Solatorobo" part of the logo. 
In regards to the variants I made available, I first created the "smooth" versions and used a roughen effect in Adobe Illustrator to make them resemble the originals. 
That is why the smooth versions exist.
